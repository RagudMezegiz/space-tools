# Space Tools

This is a set of tools for space-related applications.
It makes use of several open-source libraries to perform such tasks as
calculating rise and set times for satellites over geographic locations.

Satellite catalog information is stored in a local database that can be
updated by downloading new catalog elements from Space-Track.org.
